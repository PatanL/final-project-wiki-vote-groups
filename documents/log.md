# Development Log (Date: 10/28/22 -- 11/04/22)

## Weekly Goals
We would like to create our project idea and possible start setting up our repository.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
We created our project idea (all of us).
We created our repository (all of us)

## Problems Encountered 
Nothing so far.

## Plans for next week
Set up structure of project and ensure that the project is actually acheivable in the given time frame.
Further developments in the plan of our project will be worked out thoughout the next week.

## Optional: Questions for mentor
None for now.


# Development Log (Date: 11/04/22 -- 11/11/22)

## Weekly Goals
- Our goals for this week was to build the basic graph class, make the makefile and read the data
=> We have accomplished this 

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
- Setting up github with proposals/contracts/data (Pat)
- Discussing on what data structure is optimal for the project (all)
- Build the basic graph class & constructor (Anh)
- Debug & Optimize the constructor (Shayan)

## Problems Encountered 
- Makefile is hard to set up

## Plans for next week
- Implement traversals (BFS/DFS or both) to support our further algorithms
- Basic testing if possible

## Optional: Questions for mentor
- Not right now


# Development Log (Date: 11/12/22 -- 11/18/22)

## Weekly Goals
Implement BFS and DFS traversals to support our further algorithms.  
Basic testing on the traversals if possible

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
- Worked on BFS traversal (Shayan)
- Nothing (Pat)
- Worked on DFS traversal (Anh)

## Problems Encountered  
We were busy this week because of exams.   

## Plans for next week.   
Finish implementing the DFS(Anh) and BFS(Shayan) and finish the Floyd-Warshall algorithm(Pat). Make test cases for these alogrithms.

## Optional: Questions for mentor.  
None at the moment.


# Development Log (Date: 11/28/22 -- 12/02/22)

## Weekly Goals
Our weekly goals were to write test cases for BFS and building the graph. Implement Floyd-Warshall's algorithm, function to find the number of connected components, and write test cases for everything. We finished everything except for writing all the test cases. 

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Implemented DFS and find number of connected componenets function (Patrick).   
Implemented Floyd-Warshall's algorithm and wrote test cases for BFS and building the graph (Anh).   
Fixed makefile and header files, and BFS function (Shayan)

## Problems Encountered 
None.

## Plans for next week
- Implement reverse dfs function
- Implement Kosaraju's Algorithm
- Write test cases

## Optional: Questions for mentor
None.
